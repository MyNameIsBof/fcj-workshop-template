> Here, I can freely share my personal opinions about my experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

---

### 1. Working Environment

The working environment at First Cloud Journey (FCJ) is very dynamic and inspiring.

The workspace is professional yet comfortable, allowing me to focus and be creative easily.

Company members are friendly, open, and always ready to help when I encounter difficulties.

I think FCJ could organize more team building activities or internal sharing sessions to further strengthen team bonds.

---

### 2. Support from Mentor / Team Lead

My mentor provides very detailed guidance and always explains clearly when I don't understand an issue.

Rather than giving direct answers, the mentor encourages me to explore, analyze, and solve problems independently, helping me develop independent thinking skills.

Additionally, I had the opportunity to participate in meetings and project discussions, which gave me a better understanding of real-world workflows and technical decision-making processes in the enterprise.

---

### 3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major

The tasks I undertook are highly relevant to the Information Technology major.

As a Frontend Developer, I was able to apply knowledge about web programming, interface design, and working with databases.

Furthermore, I also gained exposure to AWS Cloud services, expanding my understanding of modern technology beyond the scope of academic learning.

---

### 4. Learning and Skill Development Opportunities

During the internship, I developed both technical and soft skills.

Technically, I significantly improved my ability to use React, Tailwind CSS, and Git, as well as how to integrate APIs effectively.

Additionally, I learned professional work skills such as time management, communication in a team environment, and Agile workflow processes.

Through review sessions and experience sharing from my mentor, I gained many valuable real-world lessons that helped clarify my career direction.

---

### 5. Company Culture and Team Spirit

FCJ's culture emphasizes collaboration, learning, and mutual respect.

Everyone is always willing to share knowledge and provide support when needed, regardless of job position.

Even during urgent projects, the team spirit remains very positive and united.

This made me feel like I was truly part of the team, even as an intern.

---

### 6. Internship Policies and Benefits

The company's internship policies are flexible and clear.

FCJ supports flexible working hours, provides reasonable internship allowances, and especially allows interns to participate in internal technical training sessions.

What I appreciate most is the opportunity to directly participate in real projects, helping me better understand product development processes in the enterprise.

---

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**

Being able to directly participate in developing the interface for a real project and receiving trust from both my mentor and the technical team.

**What should the company improve for future internship programs?**

Consider organizing additional onboarding training sessions at the beginning of the internship period to help new interns familiarize themselves more quickly with tools, repositories, and project deployment processes.

**Would you recommend this internship program to others? Why?**

Yes. I would definitely recommend FCJ to other students because it is a practical learning environment with dedicated mentors, and it helps interns develop professional skills significantly.

---

### Suggestions and Expectations

FCJ could consider organizing monthly mini hackathons or internal tech talks to encourage creativity and idea exchange among members.

I hope to have the opportunity to continue collaborating or participate in advanced internship programs at FCJ in the future.

Overall, this has been a valuable and memorable experience that helped me bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application, while significantly developing my thinking and professional skills.
