# How federal agency leaders are using AWS tools to improve efficiency

By Emma Harrison on July 9, 2025 in Amazon SageMaker, Artificial Intelligence, Customer Solutions, Generative AI, Government, Migration, Public Sector Permalink Share

Federal agencies are working to meet the demand for systems that can keep up with a tech-savvy public. Agency leaders are seizing the opportunity to restructure government by modernizing legacy systems and finding safer ways to serve citizens digitally. At the AWS Summit in Washington, DC 2025, federal leaders presented how they are using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to improve efficiency.

Agencies are using cloud tools to increase productivity, minimize resource usage, and improve their ability to serve the public effectively. This article highlights pioneering leaders who are opening new paths in government cloud computing.

## FCC modernizes 94 percent of systems

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was struggling with outdated, legacy infrastructure that was expensive and inefficient to maintain. Frequent hardware challenges, outdated application technology stacks, and increasing cybersecurity compliance challenges were putting pressure on the agency. High operating costs, limited scalability, and dependence on specialized skill sets to manage legacy systems were slowing progress. Don Tweedie, FCC Deputy Chief Information Officer for Technology Delivery, and his team recognized the need for a fundamental transformation.

Tweedie led this effort by building a strategic playbook to modernize the FCC's network architecture. His vision focused on a cloud-first approach—prioritizing scalability, security, and flexibility. The agency began treating data as a strategic asset, implementing micro-segmentation, and leveraging native cloud features like auto-scaling and serverless computing. The result was a shift toward data-driven decision-making and a more flexible infrastructure.

In just 20 months, the FCC moved 94 percent of its data center operations to the cloud and decommissioned approximately 300 underutilized servers—streamlining the technology stack and reducing operational stagnation.

Tweedie emphasized the importance of starting with small, manageable pilot programs to build momentum and organizational buy-in. He recommended engaging security groups early, reinforcing zero-trust principles, upskilling current employees to address talent shortages, and establishing clear, actionable policies to guide the transformation.

## KCNSC bridges collaboration gap

The Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) operates on behalf of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) under the Department of Energy to protect the national nuclear program. With a distributed workforce of more than 7,000 people, the agency was increasingly struggling to build an effective collaborative environment in the unclassified space. The KCNSC team was grappling with inefficient data distribution, lengthy discussions about agency resource usage, and scaling challenges.

To address this urgent issue, Victor Doane, Enterprise Architect for Digital Transformation Program, pioneered the idea of a Joint Unclassified Cloud Environment (JUCE). He invited technical leaders and other groups to come together to identify organizational needs and discuss their different cloud transformation journeys to learn from each other's experiences. Doane prioritized engaging leadership, then driving a company-wide cultural shift toward modernization with support from AWS Professional Services.

KCNSC used AWS Landing Zone Accelerator as the foundation for the unified cloud environment, then customized it to their needs. The project moved quickly: Doane presented the idea and successfully realized it in less than a year. The agency plans to use the enterprise blueprint to support other units in their cloud transformation journeys.

## NIF pursues AI to recover lost work hours

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) National Ignition Facility (NIF) owns some of the world's highest-energy lasers, capable of initiating nuclear fusion reactions similar to those that power stars. (They even created a miniature star in their lab.) The facility uses 192 laser beams controlled by thousands of subsystems. Daily, scientists use NIF to conduct physics experiments critical to national security and global energy research.

However, deteriorating infrastructure, loss of legacy system expertise as team members retired, and equipment failures were hindering research. Random system errors and lack of the integrated expertise needed to fix them effectively led to hundreds of lost test hours in 2024. LLNL needed an intelligent, scalable solution to troubleshoot equipment effectively and preserve fading legacy knowledge.

Shannon Ayers, Division Leader and Technical Manager at NIF, is part of the NIF Operations team, determined to solve these problems. They partnered with LLNL's AI Initiative to use AWS Professional Services to integrate generative AI tools into NIF's system search. The team used Amazon SageMaker to create a chat assistant using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to perform semantic search on NIF's massive incident log database. The tool generates step-by-step decision trees, giving staff instant access to experiment records and equipment recovery spanning more than 20 years. Issues that previously delayed experiments for hours can now be resolved in minutes, significantly increasing efficiency.

"AWS helped provide secure, scalable, FedRAMP-compliant infrastructure, and advanced AI tools like SageMaker and semantic search have accelerated our mission execution through improved efficiency, reduced technical debt by leveraging existing tools, and enhanced innovation by bringing together leading thinkers," Ayers stated. "The collaboration with AWS has transformed our troubleshooting process and is key to continuous operational excellence at the National Ignition Facility," she concluded.

This achievement will help NIF recover capacity to increase the number of experiments per year. In the future, the team plans to expand predictive maintenance capabilities and explore operational management tools to support the agency's critical operations through 2040 and beyond.

## USPTO sees immediate IT productivity increase using generative AI

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) grants patents and registers trademarks for creators. With increasing demand, the agency needed to modernize systems to provide more digital services without increasing resource usage. Like other agencies, USPTO's legacy infrastructure had limited its ability to meet the needs of domestic creators.

Stephan Mitchev, former Chief Technology Officer of USPTO, had a vision to improve his division's IT system efficiency. He used AWS to deploy chat assistants and code assistants into developer workflows, helping the team perform tasks like unit testing, documentation, and reverse engineering legacy code, resulting in an immediate 20% productivity increase. As of May 2025, Mitchev had brought 27 teams into the new workflow, all reporting positive results.

Mitchev's advice to teams is to start small with AI tool deployments and measure results. He emphasized using AI to augment rather than replace current employees, and advised teams to measure and demonstrate return on investment (ROI) at each step to justify continued use.
